# Loan-Approval-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting loan approval status based on applicant details using machine learning techniques.
<br>
<p>
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview <br>
The dataset consists of various financial and demographic attributes such as applicant income, credit history, loan amount, and more. The goal is to preprocess the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and apply machine learning models to predict whether a loan will be approved or not.
<br>
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized distributions of numerical features.
Checked the correlation between loan approval status and key features.
Identified patterns in income, loan amount, and credit history.
  <br>
  Model Preparation
Feature Selection: Selected relevant columns for prediction.
Encoding Categorical Data: Converted categorical variables into numerical format.
Splitting Data: Separated independent (X) and dependent (y) variables.
  <br>
  Machine Learning Model
The dataset was prepared for machine learning using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict Loan_Status.
Further models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest can be implemented to improve accuracy.
